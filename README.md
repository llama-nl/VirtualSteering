## Virtual Steering Plugin for Godot

![hippo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llama-nl/VirtualSteering/refs/heads/main/ezgif-1444f96a746d3c.gif)

A simple and customizable virtual steering wheel plugin for mobile car games and other vehicle-based projects in Godot 4

### Features
**Intuitive Touch Control:** The steering wheel is controlled by a simple drag motion.

**Customizable Sensitivity:** Adjust the `wheel_sensitivity` to fine-tune the feel of the steering.

**Auto-Return:** The wheel automatically returns to the normal rotation when the player is not touching the screen, with an adjustable return speed.

**Clampable Rotation:** Set a rotation_limit to prevent the steering wheel from rotating too far.

**Normalized Output:** Get a normalized output value between -1 and 1 for easy use with vehicle physics.

**Debug Output:** Get the steering rotation in degrees for debugging or specific use cases.

### Installation
Download the from assets library.

**Important**: For the plugin to work correctly, you must enable emulate touch from mouse in Project Settings under input_devices -> pointing.

### How to Use
Instancate the `virtual_steering.scn` scene from `addons/VirtualSteering`.

adjust the size, texture, etc if needed

Access the output from another script (e.g., your car's main script) to control your vehicle's steering.

### Example
Here's an example of how you might use the `get_output()` function in your car's script:
```gdscript
extends VehicleBody3D

@onready var virtual_steering = $"[path_to_your_VirtualSteering_node]"

func _physics_process(delta):
	# Get the steering output from the virtual steering wheel
	var steering_input = virtual_steering.get_output()
	
	# Apply the steering input to your vehicle
	steering = steering_input * 1.5 # You can multiply this value to adjust turn radius
	engine_force = 1000 # Example to move the car forward
```
### Properties
You can customize the steering wheel's behavior by adjusting the following properties in the Inspector:

**rotation_limit:** The maximum rotation limit in degrees. The wheel will not rotate beyond this value in either direction. (Default: 180)

**output_limit:** The maximum rotation in degrees that will be returned as an output. This value is used to scale the output to the -1 to 1 range. (Default: 60)

**wheel_sensitivity:** A factor that determines how much the wheel rotates in response to a drag gesture. (Default: 12, Range: 1 to 20)

**ignore_zone_inside:** Dismiss screen drag if touch comes inside it's radius (Default: 0.5, Range: 0.1 to 1)

**wheel_return_speed:** A speed factor for how quickly the wheel returns to its normal rotation when released. A smaller value means a faster return. (Default: 0.2, Range: 0.1 to 1)
